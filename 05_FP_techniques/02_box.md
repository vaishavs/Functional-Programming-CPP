# The box model
The "box" analogy is a very effective way to understand functional programming patterns. In C++, a box is not a cardboard container; it is a computational context. It is a set of strict rules governing how the item inside is allowed to be handled, moved, or altered.

## Components of the Box model
* **Data**: These are the naked C++ types such as `int`, `float`, `std::string`, or class types. This is the data/raw material on which operations are performed. They are easy to manipulate but lack any protective infrastructure.
* **Functions**: These are the operations and transformations applied on data. It acts like the machine in a factory that alters the raw material. They can be ordinary functions or [higher-order functions](https://github.com/vaishavs/Functional-Programming-CPP/blob/main/02_Designing_HO_Funcs/03_HOF.md).
* **The Context**: This is a wrapper around the raw value that provides extra context to that value. In the factory analogy, when a raw material is put into a box, it is no longer just a material; it is a material bound by the rules of logistics. Different boxes carry different contexts.
  * `std::optional`: This is like The "Schrödinger" Box. The rule is Uncertainty. The box either contains the value, or it is completely empty. It is a box with the rule: *"I might contain a value, or I might be empty."*
  * `std::vector`: This is like The "Pallet" Box. The rule is Multiplicity. The box contains zero, one, or thousands of items. It is a box with the rule: *"I contain zero, one, or many values."*
  * `std::expected<T, E>`: This is like The "Customs" Box. The rule is Strict Accountability. This box contains either the intended value, or a detailed error message. It is a box with the rule: *"I contain either a value, or an error note explaining why the value is invalid."*

# The Mechanisms
Often, it is needed to work on values that come wrapped in some kind of context. The naive way to work with such values is to unwrap them, do the computation, and rewrap. But that is tedious and it forces the programmer to handle the wrapper's meaning by hand every single time (checking for absence, propagating errors, looping over elements). In order to address this, there are 3 mechanisms in C++, each with increasing complexity:

### 1. Functor
A Functor means two unrelated things in C++ — a callable function object, and a "mappable box". In the box model, a Functor is a type that wraps a value (or values) and applies a function to what is *inside* the box without ripping it open. (*Not* [functors](https://github.com/vaishavs/Functional-Programming-CPP/blob/main/02_Designing_HO_Funcs/01_intro.md#functors)). A lovely coincidence ties them together: `std::transform`. Moving forward, a functor would mean **mappable box**, not a callable object.

A box Functor applies a standard, normal function to a wrapped value. What it does is:
- takes a normal value out of a box
- runs a regular function
- Puts the result back in a box.


A Functor handles the safety checks of a container internally. Consider a function that works on the plain value, say `f(x) = x * x`. The function does not know about boxes — it only knows `int → int`. It knows nothing about the context; it is a plain function operating on plain values. The functor machinery is what slips it inside the wrapper and back out. A functor gives one operation, traditionally called `map` (modern C++ calls it `transform`).

### 2. Applicative
An applicative applies a multi-argument function across several boxes simultaneously. It takes values out of multiple boxes, runs a multi-argument function, and puts the final result in a box. The function is itself in a box, and it is applied to a boxed argument.

A Functor takes a one-argument function. But in case of using a multi-argument function, using a functor would be very limiting. For example, consider a function that requires multiple arguments (like `add(x, y)`), and those arguments are trapped inside separate boxes.
```
auto stuck = a.transform([](int x){
    return [x](int y){ return x + y; };   // partially-applied add
});
// stuck has type: optional<  (int -> int)  >
//                 a FUNCTION, trapped inside a box
```
A functor cannot operate on multiple boxes at once. An applicative applies that multi-argument function across all the boxes simultaneously. This exact gap is what the applicative operation fills:

[![diagram-2-applicative.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/d3Qwxy4d/diagram-2-applicative.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/zbQsLVmX)

So the two steps chained together solve the problem:
```
ap( a.transform(add_curried), b )   // optional{8}
```
The payoff is combining. 

Also, the boxes are *independent* — the programmer can use all of them before knowing any of their contents. The structure is known before anything runs, so applicative computations can be analysed, optimised, and even run in parallel.

One more thing worth noticing is that every applicative is automatically a functor too. If it can combine boxes, it can certainly handle the one-box case. So, an applicative is just a more capable functor. 

### 3. Monads
A monad is the next step up from a functor and an applicative in the functional "box model". It takes a value out of a box, passes it to a function that returns a new box, and flattens the boxes to provide a simplified output.

[![diagram-3-monad.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FzzwSgTq/diagram-3-monad.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/vxRPF9FL)

Sometimes, it cannot be decide what the next computation even is until the value inside the current box is seen. For example: "look up a user id, and then — using that id — look up their account." The second box (the account lookup) literally doesn't exist until you have the id. That need is what a Monad adds. It lets a later step depend on the result of an earlier one. Here, the function takes a plain value but hands back another box.

When a monad runs a function, that function receives the actual value from the *previous* step, and it gets to decide—based on that value—what to do next. The plan is **not** fixed ahead of time anymore; it unfolds as the values come through. Also, every monad is an applicative (and therefore a functor).

# Overall picture
The cleanest way to keep them straight is by the kind of function that is being applied.
* Functor: value in, value out, with internal box handling; changes what's in the box
* Applicative: the function is itself in a box, which is what combines several boxed inputs; no dependency between steps
* Monad: the function produces its own box; each step can depend on the results before it

```
   Functor      map :  (A -> B) -> box<A> -> box<B>
      │          apply a PLAIN function inside a box
      │  (add pure + ap)
      ▼
  Applicative   ap  :  box<(A -> B)> -> box<A> -> box<B>
      │          combine SEVERAL INDEPENDENT boxes with one function
      │  (add bind)
      ▼
    Monad       bind:  box<A> -> (A -> box<B>) -> box<B>
                 each step may DEPEND on the previous value
```

Each rung includes the powers of the one above and adds more. Every monad is an applicative; every applicative is a functor. However, the reverse is **not** true — which is the point of having three names instead of one.

```
  power:   ▓▓░░░░░░░   →   ▓▓▓▓▓░░░░   →   ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓
            functor         applicative      monad
            (each level contains the one before it)
```
